NOTE: I have migrated to PyCharm, so I won't be updating this project for the foreseeable future. If anyone would like to extend it, feel free to create a new fork.

* Introduction

Pygen is a package that allows the user to automatically generate
Python code.

* Installation

Download =pygen= from MELPA using =M-x package-list-packages=. 

To load, require the package and add a hook to enable =pygen-mode=
when =python-mode= is loaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'pygen)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'pygen-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Dependencies

Pygen leverages [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][Elpy]] and [[https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode][python-mode]].  That's the package called
=python-mode= - not the mode itself.  As of Emacs 24.5.1,
=python-mode= is not the default Python mode but a separate package.
The default package is =python.el=.

Pygen won't work with a Python setup unless python-mode is installed
and Elpy is active. If you have a function that allows the user to
navigate to the definition of a function/class, you can use this
instead of Elpy.

* Commands
It provides the following code generation commands.  Scroll down for
animated examples.

| =pygen-add-decorator-to-function= | ~C-c g @~ | Adds a decorator in front of the current function.                                                                                                            |
| =pygen-selfify-symbol=            | N/A       | Puts the word =self.= in front of the current symbol.                                                                                                         |
| =pygen-unselfify-symbol=          | N/A       | Removes the word =self.= from the current symbol (if it exists).                                                                                              |
| =pygen-toggle-selfify-symbol=     | ~C-c g .~ | Toggles the word =self= in front of the current symbol.                                                                                                       |
| =pygen-insert-super=              | ~C-c g u~ | Inserts a proper call to the current method in the superclass.  This is basically a wrapper for the built-in =python-mode= function that does the same thing. |

Some of this functionality is implemented by [[https://github.com/python-rope/ropemacs][Ropemacs]]. However,
Ropemacs is slow and will not work if there are syntax errors in your
code.  Pygen is faster and more robust against syntax errors. This
comes at the cost of being less precise - in some situations, it won't
know where to generate code.  Both packages can be used alongside one
another.
