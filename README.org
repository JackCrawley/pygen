* Introduction

Pygen is a package that allows the user to automatically generate
Python code.  This allows programmers to code first and worry about
implementation details later.

* TODO Installation
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2016-10-16 Sun 17:54]
:END:

This section still needs to be completed. Installation should shortly
be available on MELPA.

* Dependencies

Pygen leverages [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][Elpy]] and [[https://launchpad.net/python-mode][python-mode]].  That's the package called
=python-mode= - not the mode itself.  As of Emacs 24.5.1,
=python-mode= is not the default Python mode but a separate package.
The default package is =python.el=.

Pygen won't work with a Python setup unless python-mode is installed.
However, it can work with a setup that doesn't include Elpy.  You just
need to tell it how to navigate to function and class definitions.  By
default, this is handled by the command =elpy-goto-definition= to
navigate to definitions and the command =pop-tag-mark=.  If you use a
different system to navigate through python code, you can set the
variable =pygen-navigate-to-definition-command= to a different
functions.

* Commands

It provides the following code generation commands.  Below are
animated examples of each command.

| =pygen-insert-super=              | ~C-c C-= u~ | Inserts a proper call to the current method in the superclass.  This is basically a wrapper for the built-in =python-mode= function that does the same thing. |

** TODO Examples
