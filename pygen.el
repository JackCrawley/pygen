;;; Commentary:

;; Pygen is a package that allows the user to automatically generate
;; Python code.  This allows programmers to code first, and worry
;; about the functions they are calling later.

;; A description is available here, but the readme has more
;; information. You can view it at
;; http://www.github.com/jackcrawley/pygen


;; It provides the following code generation commands.  For animated
;; examples of each command in action, see the GitHub page.

;; Generating Classes & Functions
;; ------------------------------

;; `pygen-generate-class' - Generate a python class from the reference
;; under point.

;; `pygen-generate-function' - Generate a python function from the
;; reference under point.

;; `pygen-generate-static-function' - Generate a static python
;; function from the reference under point.

;; Generating Variables
;; --------------------

;; `pygen-extract-variable' - Extract the current region into a
;; variable.

;; `pygen-make-keyword-argument' - Adds a keyword argument to the
;; current function.

;; `pygen-make-sequence-argument' - Adds a sequence argument to the
;; current function.

;; Automatic Decorators
;; --------------------

;; `pygen-add-decorator-to-function' - Adds a decorator in front of
;; the current function.

;; `pygen-make-static' - Turns the current function into a static
;; function.  WARNING: Not currently functional.

;; Modifying the "self" keyword:
;; -----------------------------

;; `pygen-selfify-symbol' - Puts the word 'self.' in front of the
;; current symbol.

;; `pygen-toggle-selfify-symbol' - Toggles the word 'self' in front of
;; the current symbol.

;; `pygen-unselfify-symbol' - Removes the word 'self.' from the
;; current symbol (if it exists).

;; Dynamic Boilerplate Code Generation
;; -----------------------------------

;; `pygen-insert-super' - Inserts a proper call to the current method
;; in the superclass.


;; Pygen leverages `elpy' and `python-mode'.  That's the package
;; called `python-mode', not just the mode.  As of Emacs 24.5.1,
;; `python-mode' is not the default Python mode but a separate
;; package.  The default package is called `python'.

;; Pygen won't work with a Python setup unless `python-mode' is
;; installed.  However, it can work with a setup that doesn't include
;; Elpy.  You just need to tell it how to navigate to function and
;; class definitions.  By default, this is handled by the command
;; `elpy-goto-definition' to navigate to definitions and the command
;; `pop-tag-mark'.  If you use a different system to navigate through
;; python code, you can set the variables
;; `pygen-navigate-to-definition-command' and `pygen-go-back-command'
;; to different functions.

;; TODO: generating constants

;; TODO: Possibly have a verification function when pygen commands are
;; called to ensure the required packages are installed?

;; TODO: Add Hydra

;; TODO: Work out if default python-mode follow command can be
;; used. `py-find-definition'

;; TODO: Use YASnippets for generated code if the user has YASnippet
;; installed.

;; TODO: Raise an error if a function/class already exists.

;; TODO: If the user regenerates a function/class that already exists,
;; prompt them to ask whether they want the signature modified.
;; Warnings should be more explicit if non-keyword arguments are
;; added, removed or changed.

;; TODO: Use the Elpy navigation function if it is bound and Elpy is
;; active. Otherwise, if it's possible to use the default
;; `py-find-definition' then use that.

;; TODO: Make sure that the function py-forward-class and similar
;; functions aren't used as they aren't that robust. They often elicit
;; false positives.

;; FIXME: Can't generate function if it looks like the following:
;;     variable = MyClass(function_name)
;; Instead, it just creates a function called MyClass.

;; FIXME: Can't always cope with bracketed imports, e.g:
;;     `from X import (...)'
;; Usually works, but sometimes breaks. Need to find the conditions
;; under which it breaks.
;; The conditions may have actually been the same conditions that
;; caused a different error, which is now fixed. Wait for this error
;; to pop up again before isolating it.

;; FIXME: Generating a static function when the parent is "self"
;; should throw an error. Also need to update the gif animation that
;; does just this.
