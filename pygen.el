;;; Commentary:

;; Pygen is a package that allows the user to automatically generate
;; Python code.  This allows programmers to code first, and worry
;; about the functions they are calling later.

;; A description is available here, but the readme has more
;; information. You can view it at
;; http://www.github.com/jackcrawley/pygen


;; It provides the following code generation commands.  For animated
;; examples of each command in action, see the GitHub page.

;; Generating Classes & Functions
;; ------------------------------

;; `pygen-generate-class' - Generate a python class from the reference
;; under point.

;; `pygen-generate-function' - Generate a python function from the
;; reference under point.

;; `pygen-generate-static-function' - Generate a static python
;; function from the reference under point.

;; Generating Variables
;; --------------------

;; `pygen-extract-variable' - Extract the current region into a
;; variable.

;; `pygen-make-keyword-argument' - Adds a keyword argument to the
;; current function.

;; `pygen-make-sequence-argument' - Adds a sequence argument to the
;; current function.

;; Automatic Decorators
;; --------------------

;; `pygen-add-decorator-to-function' - Adds a decorator in front of
;; the current function.

;; `pygen-make-static' - Turns the current function into a static
;; function.  WARNING: Not currently functional.

;; Modifying the "self" keyword:
;; -----------------------------

;; `pygen-selfify-symbol' - Puts the word 'self.' in front of the
;; current symbol.

;; `pygen-toggle-selfify-symbol' - Toggles the word 'self' in front of
;; the current symbol.

;; `pygen-unselfify-symbol' - Removes the word 'self.' from the
;; current symbol (if it exists).

;; Dynamic Boilerplate Code Generation
;; -----------------------------------

;; `pygen-insert-super' - Inserts a proper call to the current method
;; in the superclass.


;; Pygen leverages `elpy' and `python-mode'.  That's the package
;; called `python-mode', not just the mode.  As of Emacs 24.5.1,
;; `python-mode' is not the default Python mode but a separate
;; package.  The default package is called `python'.

;; Pygen won't work with a Python setup unless `python-mode' is
;; installed.  However, it can work with a setup that doesn't include
;; Elpy.  You just need to tell it how to navigate to function and
;; class definitions.  By default, this is handled by the command
;; `elpy-goto-definition' to navigate to definitions and the command
;; `pop-tag-mark'.  If you use a different system to navigate through
;; python code, you can set the variables
;; `pygen-navigate-to-definition-command' and `pygen-go-back-command'
;; to different functions.
